hlink - a program to compare two directories and convert distinct copies
of identical files into hard links. The two dirs MUST have identical
tree structure and filename content so before running hlink the dirs
should be synchronised with something like rsync. For example:

rsync -av --hard-links --del master_dir/ slave_dir/

followed by:

hlink master_dir slave_dir

I am aware that cp has options to do this job if you use shopt to have
it copy dot files and dot dirs. However rsync is wonderfully fast so I
am sticking with these methods.
